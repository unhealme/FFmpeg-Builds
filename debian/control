Description: Tools for transcoding, streaming and playing of multimedia files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This package contains a static build compatible with all Debian/Ubuntu
 releases, designed to facilitate Jellyfin on systems with an unpatched version
 of ffmpeg in their repository. Included files are:
  * ffmpeg: a command line tool to convert multimedia files between formats
  * ffprobe: a simple multimedia stream analyzer
  * vainfo: a command line tool to get information about local VA-API devices
